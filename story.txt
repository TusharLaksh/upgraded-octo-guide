Once upon a time, there was an octopus. However, a freak motorboat accident left him without any of his 8 tentacles. A mad scientist who found him washed up legless on the shore pitied him, luckily, and proceeded to attach 8 cybernetic tentacles to the octopus, with each tentacle being able to serve a different superhuman function. He was then ready to take on the world as the ultimate weapon.

One day, the super octopus arrived NewYork. It found a guide about octopus species and the octopus was very curious.

The octopus opened up the guide very effectively with its eight arms and found pictures of itself.

It had been viewing itself as a scary weapon. However, in the book, it was viewed as one of the most successful scientific miracle in the world. Therefore, it decided to use its superpower to the help the people in trouble. This is the begining of the Revengers.
