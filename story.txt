Once upon a time, there was an octopus. However, a freak motorboat accident left him without any of his 8 tentacles. A mad scientist who found him washed up legless on the shore pitied him, luckily, and proceeded to attach 8 cybernetic tentacles to the octopus, with each tentacle being able to serve a different superhuman function. He was then ready to take on the world as the ultimate weapon.

One day, the super octopus arrived NewYork. It found a guide about octopus species and the octopus was very curious.

The octopus opened up the guide very effectively with its eight arms and found pictures of itself.
